Some additional lints for [Schemacrawler](http://sualeh.github.io/SchemaCrawler/)

# Main purpose

The main purpose of this lint library is to enhance native schemacrawler lints
with some more hardcore constraints and some specific postgres types. That's
why a postgreSQL database instance is required to test.

This project has been created to be used at our former office
[Mairie de la Ville de Noum√©a](http://www.noumea.nc/) to test our database
schema quality in a more easy way and make it possible for our partners to
apply our database quality policy the easy way.

# Build and install lint

**Notice that this version is designed to run on schemacrawler `14.x.x`...
and hence is requiring JDK-1.8 to be built and run.**

For now the jar is not available on maven central repo, so you'll have to build it yourself :

    git clone https://github.com/mbarre/schemacrawler-additional-lints.git schemacrawler-additional-lints
    cd schemacrawler-additional-lints
    export LINT_VERSION=1.02.02

Build without testing as a local postgres install is required to test.

    mvn install -Dmaven.test.skip=true
    cp target/schemacrawler-additional-lints-${LINT_VERSION}.jar $SCHEMACRAWLER_HOME/lib

... and you're done, you just have to pass your
normal  [schemacrawler lint](http://sualeh.github.io/SchemaCrawler/lint.html)
command and enjoy.

# Build and test

To be able to test locally, assuming you have a locally postgreSQL instance
up and running with the proper `superuser` account, then run the following
commands

    dropdb --if-exists sc_lint_test
    createdb sc_lint_test
    mvn install
    cp target/schemacrawler-additional-lints-${LINT_VERSION}.jar $SCHEMACRAWLER_HOME/lib
    
Or, install [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) to deploy PostgreSQL and the database

    docker-compose -f docker/postgresql.yml up
    mvn install
    cp target/schemacrawler-additional-lints-${LINT_VERSION}.jar $SCHEMACRAWLER_HOME/lib
    
# Docker Image

Schemacrawler Additional Lints is now released with an image on Docker Hub. This is an extension of the [SchemaCrawler Docker Image](https://www.schemacrawler.com/docker-image.html).

You can run docker container like this :

    docker run --name schemacrawler-additional-lints --rm -i -t --entrypoint=/bin/bash --net=host mbarre/schemacrawler-additional-lints

--net=host option will allow you to work on database deployed on your host.

Use the Schemacrawler Interactive Shell

    schemacrawler --shell
    
Use the following script from within the shell to launch the lints analysis :

    connect --server=your_db_server --database=your_db --user=your_user
    load --info-level=minimum
    execute --command lint

Or, simplier...
    
    schemacrawler --server=your_db_server --database=your_db --user=your_user --info-level=minimum  --command lint

The docker image also includes the command which export lints in csv files, for more information see [adriens/schemacrawler-additional-command-lints-as-csv](https://github.com/adriens/schemacrawler-additional-command-lints-as-csv)

You can try it this way :

    schemacrawler --server=your_db_server --database=your_db --user=your_user --info-level=minimum  --command csv
